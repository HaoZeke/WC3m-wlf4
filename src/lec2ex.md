# W1L2: Extra Content

## About

- From this lesson on-wards we will have some **optional** material for the class
- Since there is no other resource covering the exact intersection of topics we need, we will split this material into sections
- Each of these will also feature a difficulty or level tag, which should be kept in mind

> Feel free however, to use the same hypothesis space to highlight and annotate the reading material! We will answer all questions there (this goes for other course-related reading material you might find as well).

## Mathematical Intuition

- The first chapter of [Active Prelude to Calculus](https://activecalculus.org/prelude/C-changing.html)

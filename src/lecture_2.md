# Lecture II: Time and States

## Rates and Time

Consider walking to say, a nearby park, or the supermarket.

> If we are to predict how far we can move by walking, then we need to know our starting point, and how many steps we need to take, along with the length of each step, this is all a computer needs as well.

Formally, we have:

- A starting point
- An end point
- A step size

Now with our understanding of representations, we can understand that this means we can do things at each step, say, plant a flower. In this case, the function represents planting a flower, the location is determined by our steps, and time is as we experience it.

For completeness, we mention in passing that this is what is known as a first order approximation to the derivative. Like our computer however, this has no inherent meaning for us. We will instead appeal to a more intuitive understanding.

## Modeling

What does an object **do**? What are the physical properties? A tabulated set of values might tell us relative differences, but we still need to understand what the base component **does**. This is the art of modeling. Describing the functionality of a system in a manner we can predict. That is all, and it is also exceeding complicated.

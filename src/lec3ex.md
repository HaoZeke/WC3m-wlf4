# W1L3: Extra Content

## About

As described previously, do note the following:

- These are **completely optional**
- Each of these will also feature a difficulty or level tag, which **should be kept in mind**

> Feel free however, to use the same hypothesis space to highlight and annotate the reading material! We will answer all questions there (this goes for other course-related reading material you might find as well).

| **Label** | **Expansion** |
| UG | Undergraduate |
| Intro | Introductory |

## Mathematical Intuition

- [This subsection from CLP-1](http://www.math.ubc.ca/~CLP/CLP1/clp_1_dc/subsection-2.html) (no exercises) on visualizing tangents

## Computer Science

Note that none of these are required readings and are of general interest. Suggested reading material related to this week would be the first few chapters of all three, in order perhaps, up-to functions.

- [Computer Science Circles](https://cscircles.cemc.uwaterloo.ca/) (**Intro**)
- [Think like a Programmer in python](http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/html/index.html) (**Intro**)
- [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs with Python](https://wizardforcel.gitbooks.io/sicp-in-python/content/) (**UG**)
  This is a bit of a tough read. It is meant more as an introduction to computers and their work than programming. undergraduate course which mostly introduces computer science more than programming in particular. Dry but complete.
